	    <h2>The Heck is This Nonsense?</h2>
	    <p>Humans Versus Zombies is a LARP/tag hybrid popular on college campuses about, well, you can read, can't you?
		  More specifically, the zombies are trying to make everyone just as brainless as themselves
		  (or in tag terms, make everyone "it"), while the humans are trying to keep their brains by protecing themselves 
		  with their handy and 100% mod-approved weaponry (usually socks and nerf blasters).</p>
		<p>HvZ games are played on a 24/7 basis, usually lasting a week, with the only "safe" zones being
		  inside buildings or during official events (gotta mollify campus administration somehow). There's 
		  also usually a plot and missions and whatnot, but ultimately, the real draw is the friends we killed 
		  along the way.</p>

	    <h2>A Day in the Life (Or How I Learned to Love the Brains)</h2>
		<p>Not counting mundane stuff like classes, a typical day started by stalking around campus waiting 
		  for a hapless human trying to book it to another building. After the newbies had been mostly assimilated
		  by the horde in the first couple days, any remaining survivors would usually make it to safety (hard to 
		  argue with superior firepower, especially when it's squad-sized), but that's why you'd get at least a few 
		  buddies to hunt with you; even when pickings are slim, the company is always worth it, even if they're people 
		  you might have never hung out with otherwise. As far as hunting tactics go, some zombies went for clever ambushes,
		  but I could never sit that still and mostly relied on the statistical probability that I'd run into a human eventually
		  just by wandering around.</p>
		<p>Once classes were over, it was time for missions, where both sides would gather in force to fulfill some story/gameplay-related 
		  objective (not that anyone really pays attention to story in HvZ). For zombies though, we really treated it as a chance 
		  to nom some brains in a situation where the cowardly humans couldn't just run away. Also, there were always a few gimmicks
		  to spice up mission gameplay, ranging from special respawn points to special (and usually not broken) NPCs. Looking back,
		  it's amazing the horde was able to maintain any coordination as well, given our lack of anything resembling a formal 
		  leadership structure (though walkies helped, as long as the radiozombie wasn't stunned); we were a mobocracy, but one
		  that at least still had the braaaains to listen to anyone with a modicrum of sense. Missions were very much a recipe for
		  chaos, confusion, the occasional injury, and just a dash of salt. But once a charge was called, they were exciting, and
		  that's all that mattered.</p>
