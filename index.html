	    <h2>The Heck is This Nonsense?</h2>
	    <p>Humans Versus Zombies is a LARP/tag hybrid popular on college campuses about, well, you can read, can't you?
		  More specifically, the zombies are trying to make everyone just as brainless as themselves
		  (or in tag terms, make everyone "it"), while the humans are trying to keep their brains, using 
		  their handy and 100% mod-approved weaponry (usually socks and nerf blasters).</p>
		<p>HvZ games are played on a 24/7 basis, usually lasting a week, with the only "safe" zones being
		  inside buildings or during official events (gotta mollify campus administration somehow). There's 
		  also usually a plot and missions and whatnot, but ultimately, the real draw is the friends we killed 
		  along the way.</p>
